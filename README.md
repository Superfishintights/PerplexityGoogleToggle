This extension allows you to seamlessly switch between Google Search, ChatGPT, and Perplexity (including Perplexity Pro). By typing -p or -pr at the beginning of your Google search query, the extension automatically redirects you to the corresponding Perplexity search results, providing quick access to Perplexity while allowing Google for simpler results. Use -c to send your query to ChatGPT.
